# Meeting with Roland and Bob 

- When effective speed is faster than wpm, it doesn't work. 
  - If eff > wpm, eff = wpm.
- On result, show what they selected in addition to what was sent
- Send all the params to the API
- Send all the questions and answers to the API
- Callsigns need to acommodate stroke "/"
- Bob noticed he can just remember the last two words when doing three words and can select the right answer. None of us know how we can get around this.
- Anything over 49% and you can test the next level
- Anything below 20% and you need to go down a level
  - How should we do that?
- Bob doesn't want students training with this.
  - He says they should only get two tries
- Repress the parameters when doing an assessment
  - if level is passed, represss the options
- Render all text in lower case

- Ask Roland what level I should send for level is there is none




<!-- # React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list -->
